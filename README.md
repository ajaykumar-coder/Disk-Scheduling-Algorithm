# Disk-Scheduling-Algorithm
Disk scheduling optimizes disk I/O by managing request order. FCFS serves requests sequentially, causing delays. SSTF selects the nearest request, reducing seek time but risking starvation. SCAN moves bidirectionally like an elevator. C-SCAN moves one way, resetting at the start. LOOK &amp; C-LOOK stop at the last request. EDF prioritizes deadlines
